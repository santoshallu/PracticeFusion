The algorithm for finding is similar doctors

First find the doctors with in the area code matching the given doctors speciality.
And the doctor recommendations will be displayed by review score descending

Then find the doctors outside your area but matching the given doctors speciality.
And the doctor recommendations will be displayed by review score descending.


In the future I want to extend this doctor recommendation algorithm by even distance 
if you have doctors have same rating with in given area and doctor nearest the users location/doctors location will be displayed first.
